# CSharp "C#" OpenAL Wrapper:
A simple C# wrapper for OpenAL Specification version (1.1).

To use simply include the class file to your project and make sure to point the string constant (libraryPath) 
inside that class to the right location of the OpenAL DLL.

For Windows users this will be (WindowsDrive):\Windows\System32\OpenAL32.dll, 
Note that you can also copy the dll to your project directory.
